## Project Overview

A Java database using h2 and MySQL, implemented with CRUD functionality.
The project using the idea of a Dungeons and Dragons (DnD) Non player character (NPC) database for users to find and select pre-made NPC's for their games.

### Entity Relationship Diagram 

Although out of scope for the project, a second database has been added which would synergise with the original.
This would include stats for each NPC in the database. Ideally I would have set this up to provide randomised stats for strength, wisdow and dexterity between 1-10.

### User Stories

User stories allow me to ensure that each product feature is focused and relevant to what the end user would require.
